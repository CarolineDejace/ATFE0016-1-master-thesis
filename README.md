# Master thesis: A dynamical system approach in the context of the analysis of a cortical network model simulating semantic priming.

This repository includes all source codes that were used in my master thesis. The master thesis aimed at analyzing the network model designed by Brunel and Lavigne (2009). More specifically, the thesis investigates whether that model is sensitive to parameters and/or transfer function variations.

## *Julia* Packages
The majority of codes is written in the *Julia* programming language (v1.9.0; []()) within a *Jupyter* notebook environement. Here below are the *Julia* Packages used alogn with their versions.
